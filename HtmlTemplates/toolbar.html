<h2>Step 1:</h2>
<p>
Curator HD has a scrollable toolbar which has four sections. You can view each toolbar section by scrolling up and down on each scrollbar. 
<ul> 
<li>Favorites: Icons you have moved to the favorites section.</li> 
<li>Newsletters: All the newsletters you have created.</li> 
<li>Folders: All the folders you have created.</li> 
<li>Sharing: All the sharing icons supported by Curator HD.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Step 2:</h2>
<p>Each icon from the Newsletters, Folders and Sharing sections can be added and removed from the favorites toolbar.  The favorites toolbar is the default toolbar which is displayed when the app starts.  Placing frequently used icons on the favorites toolbar makes sharing faster and easier.
